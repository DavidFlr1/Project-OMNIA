👉 **Summary**
Project OMNIA (Organized Minecraft Neural Intelligent Agents) its a Minecraft Bot Civilization project that looks to fill a world autonomous players capable to perform any in-game mechanic (farm, mine, fight, trade, build, eat, chat, etc) as well as to interact between bots to create significant and persistent connections with the common objective to organize and build an ecosystem.
We are looking to recreate the paper presented by Project Sid from AlteraAI listed here: https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer

### Problem Statement

---

Modern AI agents struggle to demonstrate persistent autonomy, adaptive behavior, and complex social interaction within dynamic, open-ended environments. Minecraft offers a rich testbed for embodied agents, yet most bot implementations remain narrowly scripted, brittle, and lack long-term memory or social coordination.

This project aims to build an AI-driven civilization within Minecraft where multiple bots, powered by modern AI architectures (LLMs, planners, memory systems), can:

- Autonomously perceive, act, and adapt.
- Perform all in-game mechanics (farming, mining, fighting, trading, building, eating and chatting).
- Build persistent relationships.
- Evolve as a coherent society with emergent behavior.

The core challenge is to integrate **autonomous agent control**, **real-time world feedback**, and **long-term memory** into a modular, scalable system.

### Success Metrics

---

Success will be evaluated across **technical**, **behavioral**, and **systemic** dimensions:

### **Autonomous Capability**

- Bots can independently navigate, mine, build, farm, and fight without direct human input.
- Task execution accuracy > 85% for multi-step tasks (e.g., “build a house” or “prepare food”).

### **Social & Civilizational Behavior**

- Bots can form persistent relationships (e.g., alliances, rivalries) stored and retrieved from memory.
- Bots coordinate to achieve shared goals (e.g., building a structure together).
- Emergent behavior is observed: e.g., faction formation, leader-following, trade or defense.

### **System Stability & Performance**

- Average bot uptime > 95% over 24h cycles.
- Inference latency per action < 500ms (LLM + decision loop).
- Seamless scaling of up to 10 bots with synchronized memory access and minimal conflict.

### **Infrastructure Scalability**

- Infrastructure can support expansion to multiple Minecraft worlds or simulation layers.
- Deployment can be reproduced easily with containerization + GCP automation.

### **User or Observer Evaluation**

- Human observers consistently identify bots as “lifelike” in behavior in blind tests.
- Positive feedback from academic or gaming communities if released publicly.

### 🤦🏼‍♀️ Risks

---

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model Latency** | LLM inference can slow down real-time decision making. | Use lightweight models or local inference for common decisions; cache recent outputs. |
| **State Desync** | Bots may act on outdated or conflicting world states. | Centralized event bus or fast polling with diff updates. |
| **Memory Complexity** | Storing and retrieving context-relevant memory across bots may get expensive or noisy. | Use structured memory (e.g., Firestore + embedding search) and decaying priorities. |
| **GCP Cost Spikes** | Running LLMs, bots, and persistent systems may incur high costs over time. | Monitor billing; offload local runs during dev; use auto-scaling; GPU only when needed. |
| **Security** | Exposed APIs (e.g., FastAPI) could be vulnerable to misuse. | Secure endpoints, validate all inputs, use rate-limiting + GCP IAM policies. |
| **LLM Hallucinations** | Bots may act unpredictably or illogically due to model output. | Combine LLMs with symbolic reasoning or constraint filters for critical tasks. |
| **Emergent Chaos** | Civilizations may collapse or behave nonsensically without guidance. | Seed with templates/goals and allow gradual learning; enforce simulation rules as needed. |
